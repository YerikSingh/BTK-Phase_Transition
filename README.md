# BTK-Phase_Transition
In this paper, we study the Kosterlitz-Thouless Phase Transition (BKT Transition) in the 2D XY Model. Implementing the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm using python, we study the behaviour of energy, magnetization, and formation of vortex and anti-vortex in the XY model to approximate the critical
temperature at which the transition occurs.
